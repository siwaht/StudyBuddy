Based on the ElevenLabs developer documentation, the APIs required for managing call logs, history, summaries, recordings, and transcripts are primarily found within the **Agents Platform** (Conversational AI) suite.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the correct APIs for the functionalities you requested:

### 1. Call Log and Call History

The **Conversations API** serves as the central resource for accessing the history of interactions handled by your AI agents.

*   **List Conversations (Call History/Log):**
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/convai/conversations`
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a paginated list of all conversations.
    *   **Key Parameters:**
        *   `agent_id`: Filter by a specific agent.
        *   `call_start_before_unix` / `call_start_after_unix`: Filter by time range.
        *   `call_successful`: Filter by the outcome (success, failure, unknown).
    *   **Response Metadata:** Includes `conversation_id`, `start_time_unix_secs`, `call_duration_secs`, `status`, and `direction`.

### 2. Call Summary

Call summaries can be retrieved directly when listing the conversation history.

*   **List Conversations with Summaries:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/convai/conversations`
    *   **Description:** To include summaries in the response, you must use the `summary_mode` parameter.
    *   **Key Parameter:**
        *   `summary_mode`: Set this to `include`.
    *   **Response:** When included, the response adds `transcript_summary` and `call_summary_title` for each conversation.

### 3. Call Transcripts

To access the full, detailed transcript of a specific interaction, you use the conversation details endpoint.

*   **Get Conversation Details:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/convai/conversations/{conversation_id}`
    *   **Description:** Retrieves the complete details of a specific conversation.
    *   **Response:** Includes a `transcript` array. Each object in the array details the `role` (user or agent), `time_in_call_secs`, and the `message` (the transcribed text).

### 4. Call Recordings

You can retrieve the audio file for any conversation managed by the Agents Platform.

*   **Get Conversation Audio:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/convai/conversations/{conversation_id}/audio`
    *   **Description:** Retrieves the full audio recording of the specified conversation.
    *   **Response:** The audio file of the conversation.

### 5. Dashboard Analytics Connection

ElevenLabs does not provide a single API endpoint that returns pre-aggregated dashboard statistics (e.g., total calls over a month, average duration graphs). Instead, you connect your analytics systems using the raw data from the APIs above and by leveraging **Webhooks** and **Agent Analysis**.

#### Agent Analysis (Data Extraction and Evaluation)

The platform includes "Agent Analysis" capabilities, which you configure within the platform to:

1.  **Success Evaluation:** Define metrics to assess conversation quality and goal achievement.
2.  **Data Collection:** Extract structured data points (e.g., customer intent, contact details) from the conversation transcript.

The results of this analysis are available in the response of `GET /v1/convai/conversations/{conversation_id}` under the `analysis` object.

#### Post-call Webhooks

This is the recommended method for feeding real-time analytics into your external systems. ElevenLabs sends a POST request to your specified endpoint after a call concludes and analysis is complete.

*   **Types:**
    *   `post_call_transcription`: Contains the full conversation data, including transcripts, analysis results (Success Evaluation and Data Collection), and metadata.
    *   `post_call_audio`: Contains the audio of the conversation.

#### Raw Data Aggregation

You can periodically pull data using `GET /v1/convai/conversations` and aggregate metrics such as `call_duration_secs` and total call counts yourself to build custom analytics dashboards.
