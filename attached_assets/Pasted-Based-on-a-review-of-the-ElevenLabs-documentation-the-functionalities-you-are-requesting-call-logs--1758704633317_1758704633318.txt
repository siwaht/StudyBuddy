Based on a review of the ElevenLabs documentation, the functionalities you are requesting—call logs, history, summaries, recordings, and transcripts—are primarily managed through the **Agents Platform (Conversational AI) APIs**. Dashboard analytics data can be accessed via the **Usage API**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the correct API endpoints for each requirement:

### Call Log and Call History

In the ElevenLabs Agents Platform, "calls" are referred to as "conversations." You use the Conversations API (prefixed with `/v1/convai/`) to access logs and history.

**1. List Conversations (Call Log):**
This endpoint retrieves a list of all conversations handled by your agents.

```http
GET /v1/convai/conversations
```

  * **Parameters:** You can filter results using `agent_id`, time ranges (`call_start_before_unix`, `call_start_after_unix`), `user_id`, and `call_successful` status. Pagination is handled via `cursor` and `page_size`.

**2. Get Conversation Details (Call History):**
This endpoint provides detailed information about a specific conversation.

```http
GET /v1/convai/conversations/:conversation_id
```

  * **Response:** Includes metadata (duration, start time), the full transcript, and analysis results (if configured).

### Call Transcripts

Transcripts are included directly within the conversation details.

  * **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/convai/conversations/:conversation_id`
  * **Details:** The response contains a `transcript` array. Each object in this array represents a turn in the conversation and includes the `role` (user or agent), `time_in_call_secs`, and the `message` (the transcribed text).

### Call Recordings

You can retrieve the audio recordings of conversations, provided that audio saving is enabled in the agent's configuration.

**1. Get Conversation Audio:**
This endpoint retrieves the audio file for a specific conversation.

```http
GET /v1/convai/conversations/:conversation_id/audio
```

**2. Check Audio Availability:**
The `GET /v1/convai/conversations/:conversation_id` endpoint includes boolean flags such as `has_audio`, `has_user_audio`, and `has_response_audio` to verify if recordings exist before attempting to download them.

### Call Summary

ElevenLabs provides two main ways to obtain call summaries:

**1. Automated Summaries in List View:**
You can request summaries directly when listing conversations.

```http
GET /v1/convai/conversations?summary_mode=include
```

  * **Details:** Setting `summary_mode` to `include` adds `transcript_summary` and `call_summary_title` fields to the response for each conversation.

**2. Agent Analysis (Custom Extraction and Summary):**
You can configure "Agent Analysis" within the platform for more advanced needs. This includes:

  * **Data Collection:** Extracting structured data (e.g., customer intent, contact details).
  * **Success Evaluation:** Assessing if the conversation met predefined goals.

The results of Agent Analysis are available in the `analysis` field when calling `GET /v1/convai/conversations/:conversation_id`, or they can be pushed to your system in real-time via **Post-call Webhooks**.

### Dashboard Analytics Connection

To programmatically access data similar to that shown in the ElevenLabs dashboards (both general usage and agent performance), you can use the Usage API.

**1. Get Character Usage Metrics:**
This endpoint provides detailed statistics that power the Usage Analytics Dashboard, allowing you to reconstruct visualizations and monitor consumption.

```http
GET /v1/usage/character-stats
```

  * **Parameters:**
      * `start_unix` / `end_unix`: Define the time range.
      * `aggregation_interval`: Aggregate data by `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, or `cumulative`.
      * `breakdown_type`: Analyze usage by dimensions such as voice, product, API key, or user.
      * `metric`: Specify the metric to aggregate (e.g., `credits_used`, `requests_count`).

**2. Agents Platform Specific Analytics:**
While the Usage API covers overall consumption, specific performance analytics for agents (like success rates or extracted data trends) are derived from the aggregated results of **Agent Analysis** collected via the Conversations API or Webhooks. Additionally, the API reference indicates specific endpoints for tracking **LLM Usage** within the Agents Platform (related to `/v1/convai/llm-usage`).
